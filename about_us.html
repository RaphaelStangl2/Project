<h1><span>About Us</span></h1>
</header>
    <div>
    <p>We are a Team of two young developers that strives to make people eat healthier without doing very strict diets. In the next few point, we will tell you what you need to do to eat and feel healthier.</p>

    <h2>Basic Components of food</h2>
    <div>
    <p>Before we talk about what to cook and how to eat healthier, we need to learn about the 6 basic components of food and what each component is for. </p>

    <h3>Protein</h3>
    <div>
    <p>Protein is having its moment, and not just in the workout community. But all the hype is for a good reason. Protein is essential for good health.</p>
    <p>Protein provides the building blocks of the body, and not just for muscle. Every cell, from bone to skin to hair, contains protein.</p>
    <p>A startling 16 percent of the average person’s body weight is from protein. Protein is used primarily for growth, health, and body maintenance.</p>
    <p>All your hormones, antibodies, and other important substances are composed of protein. Protein is not used to fuel the body unless necessary.</p>
  </div>
    <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
    <div>
    <p>Don’t let the low-carb craze fool you. Carbohydrates are necessary for a healthy body. Carbs fuel your body, especially your central nervous system and brain, and protect against disease, according to the Mayo Clinic.
      Carbohydrates should make up 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories.
    </p>
  </div>
    <h3>Fats</h3>
    <div>
    <p>Fats often get a bad rap, but recent research has shown that healthy fats are an important part of a healthy diet.</p>
    <p>According to Harvard Medical School, fat supports many of your body’s functions such as vitamin and mineral absorption, blood clotting, building cells, and muscle movement. Yes, fat is high in calories, but those calories are an important energy source for your body.</p>
  </div>
    <h3>Vitamins</h3>
    <div>
    <p>Vitamins are vital for warding off disease and staying healthy. The body needs these micronutrients to support its functions. There are 13 essential vitamins that the body needs to function properly, including vitamins A, C, B6, and D.</p>
    <p>Each vitamin plays an important role in the body, and not getting enough of them can cause health problems and disease. Many Americans do not get enough of many essential vitamins. Vitamins are essential for healthy vision, skin, and bones.</p>
    <p>Vitamins may lower the risk of lung and prostate cancer, and they’re powerful antioxidants. Vitamins like vitamin C boost the immune system and help the body heal.</p>
  </div>
    <h3>Minerals</h3>
    <div>
    <p>Much like vitamins, minerals help support the body. They’re essential for many body functions, including building strong bones and teeth, regulating your metabolism, and staying properly hydrated. Some of the most common minerals are calcium, iron, and zinc.</p>
    <p>In addition to strengthening bones, calcium helps with nerve signal transmission, maintaining healthy blood pressure, and muscle contraction and relaxation. Iron supports your red blood cells and hormone creation, while zinc boosts your immune system and wound healing.</p>
  </div>
    <h3>Water</h3>
    <div>
    <p>You can go for weeks without food, but you can’t last more than a few days without water. Water is crucial for every system in your body. It’s also the main thing you are made of. About 62 percent of your body weight is water.</p>
  </div>

    <h2>What makes Food healthy</h2>

    <div>
    <p>While every human probably has a basic understanding of what healthy food is, there is still a lot of misunderstanding and misconception.</p>
    <h3>”Healthy Food” Definition</h3>
    <div>
    <p>“Healthy foods are those that provide you with the nutrients you need to sustain your body’s well-being and retain energy.”</p>
    <p>This information tells us we need to focus on eating fresh foods that provide us with the nutrients our bodies need.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the food industry doesn’t make as much of a profit on fresh foods; processed foods is where the money is. Even big food companies have lobbied aggressively against public health plans - such as a campaign ordering the removal of junk food from schools.</p>
  </div>
    <h3>What should a Person eat to stay healthy?</h3>
    <div>
    <p>A healthy eating plan is one that encompasses all of the nutrients your body needs on a daily basis without any non-nutritional additives.</p>
    <p>A healthy, balanced diet includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetables and any subgroup such as beans, peas and starches</li>
      <li>Whole Fruits</li>
      <li>Whole grains such as quinoa, corn, millet, and brown rice</li>
      <li>Limited full-fat dairy</li>
      <li>A variety of protein such as lean meats, eggs, nuts, seeds, and soy products</li>
      <li>Oils such as olive, flaxseed, canola, and avocado</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Only about one-fourth of the population is eating the recommended amounts of fruit, vegetables, dairy, and oils. However, over half of the population are meeting or going beyond the total grains and protein recommendations.</p>
    <p>When consuming grains, it’s encouraged to only eat whole grains that include the entire grain kernel, bran, and germ. If you are eating refined grains (or processed grains), the bran and germ have been removed which takes out the iron, dietary fiber, and other key nutrients.</p>
  </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Healthy Sources of Fats and Carbohydrates</h2>

    <div>
    <p>While Fats and Carbohydrates are often considered unhealthy, they are still essential for your life. However, it is very important that you eat these nutrient threw healthy and natural sources. </p>
    <h3>Healthy Fat sources:  </h3>
    <div>
    <p>The most famous unsaturated fats are omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Unsaturated fats are important for your body as they provide essential fatty acids your body can’t make. You can find these healthy fats in nuts, seeds, fish, and vegetable oils (like olive, avocado, and flaxseed). Coconut oil provides plant-based fats in the form of medium-chain triglycerides which impart health benefits like faster utilization by organs as fuel and appetite control.</p>
    <p>Avoid trans fats and limit your intake of saturated animal-based fats like butter, cheese, red meat, and ice cream.</p>
  </div>
    <h3>Healthy Carbohydrate sources:</h3>
    <div>
    <p>Before you reach for the white bread or pasta, keep in mind that the type of carb you eat matters. Some carbs are healthier than others. Opt for whole grains, beans, and fiber-rich vegetables and fruits instead of refined grains and products with added sugar.</p>
